# games
Various games implemented in various languages.

This will keep track of all languages I've learned.  

In order of (perceived) ascending difficulty:

* Guess a number: `python`
* Hangman: `Haskell`, `C++`
* Tic-tac-toe: `C`
* Pong: 
* Flappy Box: `JavaScript`
* Minesweeper: 
* Tetris: `Haskell`
* Snake: `C++` 

Languages I hope to add: `Lisp`, `Rust`, `x86`
