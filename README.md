# games
Various games implemented in various languages.

A good way to learn new languages, and also a good way to keep track of what I can write!

In order of (perceived) ascending difficulty:

* Guess a number: `Python`
* Hangman: `Haskell`, `C++`
* Tic-tac-toe: `C`
* Pong: `Rust` (WIP)
* Flappy Box: `JavaScript`
* Minesweeper: ??
* Tetris: `Haskell`
* Snake: ??

Hopeful additions: `TypeScript`, `PureScript`, `Lisp`

Realistic additions: `Java`, `Rust`
